title: "U2️⃣: Population & Migration Patterns & Processes"
---

You’ll explore the patterns associated with human populations.
12-17% of the multiple choice AP Exam

---

## Topic 2.1: Population Distribution
Why would someone live in this location versus that location?

---

Human factors that influence the ditrubition of human populations:
1. Economic Factors
2. Political Factors
3. Cultural Factors
4. Historical Factors

### Types of Population Density

**Arithmatic Density** - $\frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Ammount Of Land}}$
	Shows how spread out people are.
**Physilogical Density** - $\frac{\text{Population}}{\text{Arable Land}}$
	Shows how much stress is being put on the land.
**Agricultural Density** - $\frac{\text{Number of Farmers}}{\text{Arable Land}}$ 
	Shows how andvanced the society is, the lower the number, the more people are free to do other jobs that aren't farming.

## Topic 2.2: Consequences of Population Distribution
Populations are changing all over the world

---

### Main Population Growth Centers of the World
1. South Asia
2. Southeast Asia
3. East Asia
4. Europe (Slowing down)

### Population Density vs Distubition

**Population Density** - How many people are living in this one spot.
**Population Distributuion** - How are people located.
Density allows geographers to understand a lot about a state.

### Carrying Capacity
How many people can live in an area without causing harm to the enviroment.
If the carrying capacity is exceeded, things will go real bad, real quick.


## Topic 2.3: Population Composition
Looking at age structures, demgraphic data, gender data, and Population Pyramids

---

### Population Pyrmids
Example of a population pyrmid of Angola (2005)
![[img/Angola_population_pyramid_2005.svg]]
- Shows age ranges, including pre-reproductive years, reproductive years, and post-reproductive years. 
- Broken down by gender, shows how society is operating and also possible historcal events.
- Less kids (Low Brith Rate) = More economiclly advanced
- More kids (High Brith Rate) = Less economiclly advanced
- Working Age Men (Guest Workers) - They exist!
- Large drop off - Just men - External War - Men & Women - Internal War


## Topic 2.4: Population Dynmaics
CBR, CDR, NIR, TFR

---

**Crude Birth Rate** - Total number of live births in a year for every 1,000 people alive.
**Crude Death Rate** - Total number of deaths in a year for every 1,00 people alive.
**Natural Increase Rate** - The percentage a population grows by in a year.
**Total Fertility Rate** - The average number of children a woman will give birth to in their lifetime. (2.1 replaces the current population)

#### Economic Advances
As the economy advances, deaths go down and people lives longer.\
**Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)** - Total Number of deaths of children less than 1 year old for every 1,00 people alive.
	Goes down as the economy advances
