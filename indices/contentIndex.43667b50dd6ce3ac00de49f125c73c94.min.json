Check the title.\n2. Check the Key/Legend.\n3. Check the connection and make a connection to the map.\n4. Look at the question\n\n### Absolute Distance vs Relative Distance\n**Absolute Distance** - Quantitative (numbers) forms\n**Relative Distance** - Qualitative (approximate) forms\n\n### Clustering \u0026 Dispersal\n**Clustering** - How close things are in a space.\n**Dispersal** - How far things are apart in a space.\n\n### Map Projections to Know\n**Mercator** - Originally used for travel via the sea, distorts shape and size of land masses but maintains distance and direction.\n\n![[notes/img/Mercator_projection_Square.jpg]]\n\n**Goode Homolosine** - Minimizes distortion due to being an interrupted map (part of the world are removed).\n\n![[notes/img/Goode_homolosine_projection_SW.jpg]]\n\n**Fuller** - Does not use cardinal directions, maintains shape \u0026 size.\n\n![[notes/img/Fuller_projection.png]]\n\n**Robinson** - Spreads distortion across shape, size \u0026 direction.\n\n![[notes/img/Robinson_projection_SW.jpg]]\n\n**Winkel Tripel** - Rounder in shape with distortion near the southern and northern poles.\n\n![[notes/img/Winkel_triple_projection_SW.jpg]]\n\n## Topic 1.2: Geographic Data\nHow Businesses, Individuals, Organizations, etc. use data \u0026 how data is collected.\n\n---\n\n### Qualitative v. Quantitative\n\n**Qualitative** - Think more about opinions, less measurable.\n**Quantitative** - Think about exact things that focus on data.\n\n### Examples of data collection\n\n**Government** - Census.\n**Businesses** - Focus Groups, Polls, and possibly even the Census.\n**Individuals** - Surveys and Polls\n\n### Geographic Information System\nA system that analyzes, manages and displays lots of information on a particular geographic area.\nCan create Layered Maps.\nOften Uses GPS\n\n## Topic 1.3: The Power of Geographic Data\nElaborating on Geographic Data\n\n---\n### Scale\n**Scale**: Distance Ratio that compares the size of something on the map to the size of something on Earth\n**Personal, Government, and Organization Scales:**\n\n| Personal | Businesses | Organization | Government |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Looking at schools, crime rates, etc. to better understand the direction of a community, decide where to live, etc. | To better understand their customer base, decide where to put new stores, etc. | Depends on the size of the org. Helps them decide how to best serve the community | Uses them for lots of things. School locations, polling locations, redistricting of voting districts, etc. | \n\n### Census\nAn official count of individuals in a population and a collection of demographic data.\nNormally every 10 years.\nHow federal funding is determined.\nHelps see where people are moving.\nHelps determine redistricting.\n\n## Topic 1.4: Spatial Concepts\n---\n\n**Absolute Location** - Uses latitude and longitude, exact location that doesn't move.\n**Relative Location** - Uses surroundings, not precise.\n\n### Distance Decay \u0026 Space Time Compression\n\n**Space Time Compression** - The increasing sense of connectivity, due to advancements in technology, that reduces the impact of distance decay.\n**Distance Decay** - The effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions (The further the distance apart, the less interaction will occur).\n\n### Place\n\nWhen Geographers discuss **Place** they break it down into 2 groups:\n**Physical characteristics** - Rivers, Mountains, Vegetation, and Climate\n**Human characteristics** - Religion, Language, Population, and Other Demographic Information\n\n## Topic 1.5: Human-Environmental Interaction\nConstant back and forth between the environment and between society.\n\n---\n\n### Sustainability\nIs the current generation using their resources in a way that does not damage the environment for future generations\n\n### Environmental Possibles vs Determinism \n**Environmental Possibles** -  The belief that the physical environment plays a role in the success of a society, but the culture can overcome environmental factors.\n**Environmental Determinism** - The belief that the environment determines the success of a society.\n\n## Topic 1.6: Scales of Analysis\n\n**Scale of Analysis**: Observation of data at the global, national, regional, and local scale. (The focus is how the data is organized \u0026 presented on the map)\n\n**Scale of Inquiry** - Asking what the best scale of analysis possible would be for a given map\n\n**Small Scale** - Zoomed out map\n\n**Large Scale** - Zoomed in map\n\nDifferent scales and scales of analysis help geographers to analyze.\n\n## Topic 1.7: Regional Analysis\n\n--- \n\n**Region** - An area that is grouped together by perceived or measurable common characteristics (i.e. language, culture, topography, etc.)\n\nRegions can be observed on a variety of scales, allowing us to observe different data.\n\n### Types of Regions\n- **Formal** (Uniform) - Geographic area with common characteristics. *Note: some formal regions have boundaries that can shift.*\n- **Functional** (Nodal) - Geographic area organized around a center point. (normally Transportation, Economic, Communication) (i.e. TV Station, Disney World, Mall of America, Airport, etc.)\n- **Vernacular** (Perceptual) - Geographic area with precised common characteristics. (Causes lots of debates.)\n\n\n---\n\n***Image Sources***\n\n| # | Info |\n| --- | --- |\n|1| By Strebe - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=17700069 | |\n|2| By Strebe - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=16115269| |\n|3| By Justin Kunimune - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=65694588| \n|4| By Strebe - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=16115337\n|5| By Strebe - Own work, Public Domain, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=16115375\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T01:34:34.380329063Z","tags":null},"/Unit-2":{"title":"U2Ô∏è‚É£: Population \u0026 Migration Patterns \u0026 Processes","content":"\nYou‚Äôll explore the patterns associated with human populations.\n12-17% of the multiple choice AP Exam\n\n---\n\n## Topic 2.1: Population Distribution\nWhy would someone live in this location versus that location?\n\n---\n\nHuman factors that influence the ditrubition of human populations:\n1. Economic Factors\n2. Political Factors\n3. Cultural Factors\n4. Historical Factors\n\n### Types of Population Density\n\n**Arithmatic Density** - $\\frac{\\text{Population}}{\\text{Ammount Of Land}}$\n\tShows how spread out people are.\n**Physilogical Density** - $\\frac{\\text{Population}}{\\text{Arable Land}}$\n\tShows how much stress is being put on the land.\n**Agricultural Density** - $\\frac{\\text{Number of Farmers}}{\\text{Arable Land}}$ \n\tShows how andvanced the society is, the lower the number, the more people are free to do other jobs that aren't farming.\n\n## Topic 2.2: Consequences of Population Distribution\nPopulations are changing all over the world\n\n---\n\n### Main Population Growth Centers of the World\n1. South Asia\n2. Southeast Asia\n3. East Asia\n4. Europe (Slowing down)\n\n### Population Density vs Distubition\n\n**Population Density** - How many people are living in this one spot.\n**Population Distributuion** - How are people located.\nDensity allows geographers to understand a lot about a state.\n\n### Carrying Capacity\nHow many people can live in an area without causing harm to the enviroment.\nIf the carrying capacity is exceeded, things will go real bad, real quick.\n\n\n## Topic 2.3: Population Composition\n\n\n\n## Topic 2.4: Population Dynmaics\n\n\n\n## Topic 2.5: The Demographic Transition Model\n\n\n\n## Topic 2.6: Malthusian Theory\n\n\n\n## Topic 2.7: Population Polices\n\n\n\n## Topic 2.8: Women \u0026 Demographic Changes\n\n\n\n## Topic 2.9: Aging Populations\n\n\n\n## Topic 2.10: Causes of Migration\n\n\n\n## Topic 2.11: Forced and Volentary Migration\n\n\n\n## Topic 2.12: Effects of Migration\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-16T01:34:34.380329063Z","tags":null}}
